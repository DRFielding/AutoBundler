# AutoBundler
A bundling automation tool

## How to use
1. Extract all documents required into individual PDFs.  These MUST be named in the following format:
[key];[name];[YYYY-MM-DD]
2. Run the program, enter the directory into the command line (Easiest way is to navigate to the folder in windows explorer, select the path and copy it)
3. You should now have a bundle correctly ordered and a text file with the list of documents.  Simply open the bundle with Adobe Acrobat and add page numbers to paginate, and copy the table into your AutoDocs generated list of documents
